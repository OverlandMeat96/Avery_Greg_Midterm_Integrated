					<p>Alexander Keith's beer has been raised in Nova Scotia since 1820. It's a province where the water informs every aspect of its character from dramatic scenery, to distinctive culture and of course, exceptional beer. The coast itself is where everything comes together: the land, the sea, and the people who have called it all home for generations. Our inspiration since 1820, is derived from these remarkable qualities and the extraordinary people met along the way.</p>

							<h5>History</h5>
							<p>Alexander Keith's is a​ brewery​ in​ Halifax, Nova Scotia​, Canada. It is part of Anheuser-Busch InBev​, a holdings company based in​ Leuven​, Belgium, which owns over 400 beer brands globally. The brewery was founded in 1820 by​ Alexander Keith​ who had immigrated from​ Scotland​ three years previously. He was 25 at the time. In 1928, the business was sold to​ Oland Brewery​, which was in turn sold to the​ Labatt Brewing Company​.  By the 1990s Alexander Keith's​ India Pale Ale​ (IPA) was the most popular beer in Nova Scotia.  Alexander Keith’s products were originally produced in the Halifax brewery only for sale in the​ Maritimes</p>
