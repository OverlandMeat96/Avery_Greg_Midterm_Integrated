# Midterm Integrated Project

This is my midterm integrated project. The first pageis the home of our brand mashup and features promotional images and info for the products that are featured. The second page is the product page, which presents the many different products available. The two brands that we are working with are Alexander Keith's and Puma - Speed Orbiter.
